
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
And blister you all o'er!
I must eat my dinner.
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
Water with berries in't, and teach me how
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
That burn by day and night
O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
This isle with Calibans.
You taught me language; and my profit on't
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
For learning me your language!
No, pray thee.
I must obey
