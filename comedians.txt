
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
This cannot anger him
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
A challenge, on my life.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!
Without his roe, like a dried herring
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
Well said
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short
A sail, a sail!
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast
The fee-simple! O simple!
By my heel, I care not.
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.
Come, sir, your passado.
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
