
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in
Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word
I mean, sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
That dreamers often lie.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces of the smallest spider's web,
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
Not so big as a round little worm
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
He is wise;
And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
Nay, I'll conjure too.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh
This cannot anger him
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night
Where the devil should this Romeo be?
Came he not home to-night?
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
A challenge, on my life.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft
More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!
Without his roe, like a dried herring
The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Right.
Well said
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
sharp sauce.
O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short
A sail, a sail!
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
fairer face.
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
dial is now upon the prick of noon.
Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
wisely, wisely.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
An old hare hoar,
And an old hare hoar,
Is very good meat in lent
But a hare that is hoar
Is too much for a score,
When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
to dinner, thither.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'lady, lady, lady.'
Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast
The fee-simple! O simple!
By my heel, I care not.
And but one word with one of us? couple it with
something; make it a word and a blow.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.
Come, sir, your passado.
I am hurt.
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
They have made worms' meat of me
I shall no more to sea, to sea,
Here shall I die ashore--
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
funeral
What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
and it shall be said so again while Stephano
breathes at's nostrils.
This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle
Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
which will give language to you, cat
Four legs and two voices
Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
a devil, and no monster
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth
Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
cast ashore.
Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
duck, thou art made like a goose.
The whole butt, man
Out o' the moon, I do assure thee
Come, swear to that; kiss the book
Come on then; down, and swear.
Come, kiss.
I prithee now, lead the way without any more
talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
else being drowned, we will inherit here
O brave monster! Lead the way.
Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
water; not a drop before
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
good moon-calf.
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head
Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
and so shall Trinculo.
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
That's most certain.
How now shall this be compassed?
Canst thou bring me to the party?
Trinculo, run into no further danger
Didst thou not say he lied?
Do I so? take thou that.
Beats TRINCULO
As you like this, give me the lie another time.
Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
off.
Stand farther. Come, proceed.
Is it so brave a lass?
Monster, I will kill this man
Give me thy hand
Ay, on mine honour.
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
Sings
Flout 'em and scout 'em
And scout 'em and flout 'em
Thought is free.
What is this same?
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness
He that dies pays all debts
No, monster, not I.
This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
have my music for nothing.
That shall be by and by
Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
this tabourer; he lays it on.
Monster, your fairy, which you say is
a harmless fairy, has done little better than
played the Jack with us.
So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
a displeasure against you, look you,--
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
monster, but an infinite loss.
I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
for my labour.
Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
that gown.
Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
the line
I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't
Monster, lay-to your fingers
Ay, and this.
Every man shift for all the rest, and
let no man take care for himself; for all is
but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
I should have been a sore one then.
I shall no more to sea, to sea,
Here shall I die ashore--

A friend.
Stephano is my name; and I bring word
My mistress will before the break of day
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
For happy wedlock hours.
None but a holy hermit and her maid.
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
